# Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning Journey repository! This repository contains my daily code uploads as I learn and practice machine learning concepts and techniques.

## About

I am currently learning machine learning at Symbiosis Skills and Professional University (SSPU). This repository serves as a record of my progress and a place to share my work with others.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by date, with each folder containing the code and related materials for that day's work. 


## Contents

- **Code**: Jupyter notebooks or scripts containing the code I wrote each day.
- **Data**: Any datasets used in the day's work.
- **Notes**: A summary of what I learned and any important observations or reflections.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the desired date's folder**:
