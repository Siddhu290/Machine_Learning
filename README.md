# Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning Journey repository! This repository contains my daily code uploads as I learn and practice machine learning concepts and techniques.

## About

I am currently learning machine learning at Symbiosis Skills and Professional University (SSPU). This repository serves as a record of my progress and a place to share my work with others.

## Contents

- **Code**: Jupyter notebooks or scripts containing the code I wrote each day.
- **Data**: Any datasets used in the day's work.
