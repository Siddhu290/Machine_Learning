        "### GROUP BY Clause\n",
        "The **GROUP BY** clause is used to group rows from a result set into summary rows based on the values of one or more columns. It's often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX) to perform calculations on groups of data.\n",

        "### HAVING Clause\n",
        "The **HAVING** clause is used to filter groups of data after they have been aggregated. It's similar to the WHERE clause, but it operates on groups, not individual rows.\n",
        "\n",

        "**A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.** It presents a customized perspective of data from one or more underlying tables. Essentially, it acts as a filter, allowing you to see only the data you need without affecting the base tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Characteristics\n",
        "* **Virtual:** Views don't physically store data; they are derived from other tables when accessed.\n",
